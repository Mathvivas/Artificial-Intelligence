--- word2vec ---

Algorithm for generating distributed representations of words. 
In the end of the process, every word ends up being just a vector, or a sequence of numbers.
The AI is able to generate words that really are very similar to book not in letters or sounds, but in meaning.

We can also compute the difference between words based on how different their vectors are. For example:
the difference between king and man is similar to the difference between queen and woman.
That is, if we add the difference between king and man to the vector for woman, the closest word to the resulting vector is queen.

By using neural networks and distributed representations for words, we get our AI to understand semantic similarities between words
in the language.
