-- Depth-First Search --

Search algorithm that always expands the deepest node in the 
frontier.

-- Breadth-First Search --

Search algorithm that always expands the shallowest node in the
frontier.

-- Greedy Best-First Search --

Search algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, 
as estimated by a heuristic function h(n).

-- A* Search --

Search algorithm that expands node with lowest value of g(n) + h(n).

g(n) = cost to reach node
h(n) = estimated cost to goal
