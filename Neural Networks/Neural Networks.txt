- Neural Network

Neurons are connected to and receive electrical signals from other
neurons.
Neurons process input signals and can be activated.

- Artificial Neural Network

Mathematical model for learning inspired by biological neural 
network.
Model mathematical function from inputs to outputs based on the 
structure and parameters of the network.
Allows for learning the networks's parameters based on data.

h(x1, x2) = wo + w1x1 + w2x2

- Step Function --> g(x) = 1 if x >= 0, else 0

- Logistic Sigmoid Function --> g(x) = (e^x) / (e^x + 1)
Gera Probabilidade, pois possui números reais.

- Rectified Linear Unit Function (ReLU) --> g(x) = max(0, x)

___ OR ___

Usando a Step Function --> g(-1 + 1x1 + 1x2)

If x1 = 0 and x2 = 0, then g() = 0
If x1 = 1 and x2 = 1, then g() = 1

___ AND ___

Usando a Step Function --> g(-2 + 1x1 + 1x2)

-- Gradient Descent --

Algorithm for minimizing loss when training neural network.

- Start with a random choice of weights.
- Repeat:
	- Calculate the gradient based on all data points:
	direction that will lead to decreasing loss.
	- Update weights according to the gradient.

-- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent --

- Start with a random choice of weights.
- Repeat:
	- Calculate the gradient based on one small batch:
	direction that will lead to decreasing loss.
	- Update weights according to the gradient.


-- Perceptron --

- Only capable of learning linearly separable decision boundary.


-- Multilayer Neural Network --

- Artificial neural network with an input layer, an output layer, 
and at least one hidden layer.
- Gera a habilidade de calcular funções mais complexas.


-- Backpropagation --

- Algorithm for training neural networks with hidden layers.
- Start with a random choice of weights.
- Repeat:
	- Calculate error for output layer.
	- For each layer, starting with output layer, and moving
	inwards towards earliest hidden layer:
		- Propagate error back one layer.
		- Update weights.


-- Deep Neural Networks --

- Neural network with multiple hidden layers.
